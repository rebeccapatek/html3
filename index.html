<h1>Tables</h1>

<p>To display data in a table format, we must create the table to content the data using the &lt;table&gt; element.</p>

<p>In html, the rows, columns, and cells that will hold data must be created individually.</p>

<p>The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element.</p>
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; for each one

<p>Adding rows won't actually add any cells with data to your table.  Each cell element must also be defined. In order to do this you must add a table data element. For each row, add as many table data elements as you would like for columns across.</p>

<p>To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: &lt;th&gt;.
These elements helps to describe what the data within the table represents.
Just like table data, a table heading element must be placed within a table row.</p>

<p>This code:</p>
<div>&lt;table&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;tr&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Saturday&lt;/th&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;th scope="col"&gt;Sunday&lt;/th&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;tr&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Temperature&lt;/th&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;td&gt;73&lt;/td&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;td&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/tr&gt;</div>
<div>&lt;/table&gt;</div>
<div>Would display this:</div>
<table>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
      <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
      <td>73</td>
      <td>81</td>
    </tr>
  </table>





<p>Note that the first row has a blank heading, and a Saturday, Sunday heading.  The blank heading creates the extra table cell necessary to align the able headings correctly over the data that matches up with it. In the second row, the table heading Temperature was added.</p>

<h4>Note also the use of the scope attributes.</h4>
  <ol>
      <li>row - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a row.</li>
      <li>col - this value makes it clear that the heading is for a column.</li>
  </ol>


<p>In order to make a table more readable, you should add a border.  The convention now is top do this in CSS.  For example:</p>


<div>table, td {</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid black;</div>
<div>}</div>

<p>would be stored in a <strong>style.css</strong> document.</p>

<p>Another attribute of the &lt;td&gt; is the colspan. This attribute accepts an integer greater or equal to one to denote the number of columns it spans across.</p> 

<p>You could also assign the rowspan attribute to a &lt;td&gt; with a value greater or equal to the  number or rows that you want the data to cover.</p>

<p>For long tables, you can use the table body element &lt;tbody&gt; to section off all of the table's data, and exclude the table's headings.
It makes sense to section off the table's column headings using the table head &lt;thead&gt; element as well when you are sectioning off the table' body.</p>

<p>The Table footer element (&lt;tfoot&gt;) is another way to section off a longer table.  Note that the footer element must still contain the table row element and any table data within that row.  Table footers are ofter used to contain sums, differences, and other data results.</p>

<p>Tables by default are very blank.  They have no borders, the font color is black, and the typeface is the same type used for other HTML elements.</p>    

<p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a language that web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page.  You can use CSS to style tables.  Specifically, it is nice to style the various aspects mentioned above.  Here is an example of the styling you might have for a table:</p>

<div>table, th, td {</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid black;</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;</div>
  <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;text-align: center;</div>
  <div>} </div>

<h1>How Does the INTERNET work?</h1>

<p>You can think of the internet as a network of computers which send and receive information.  Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate. The HTTP request instructs the receiving computer how to handle the incoming info.  
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is used to structure requests and responses over the internet. HTTP requires data to be transferred from one point to another over the network. Think of HTTP command language that the devices on both sides of the connection must follow in order to communicate.</p>

<p>The transfer of resources happens using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). In viewing this webpage, TCP manages the channels between your browser and the server. TCP is used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer or device wants to send something to another.</p>

<h4>HTTP & TCP: How it Works</h4>
<p>When you type an address into your browser, you are commanding it to open a TCP channel to the server that responds to that URL (or Uniform Resource Locator). A URL is like your home address or phone number because it describes how to reach you.</p>

<p>In this situation, your computer, which is making the request, is called the client. The URL you are requesting is the address that belongs to the server.</p>

<p>Once the TCP connection is established, the client sends a HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage it should display. After the server has sent the response, it closes the TCP connection. If you open the website in your browser again, or if your browser automatically requests something from the server, a new connection is opened which follows the same process described above. GET requests are one kind of HTTP method a client can call. </p>

<p>Let’s explore an example of how GET requests (the most common type of request) are used to help your computer (the client) access resources on the web.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to check out the latest course offerings from http://codecademy.com. After you type the URL into your browser, your browser will extract the http part and recognize that it is the name of the network protocol to use. Then, it takes the domain name from the URL, in this case “codecademy.com”, and asks the internet Domain Name Server to return an Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>

<p>Now the client knows the destination’s IP address. It then opens a connection to the server at that address, using the http protocol as specified. It will initiate a GET request to the server which contains the IP address of the host and optionally a data payload. The GET request contains the following text:</p>

<p>GET / HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>Host: www.codecademy.com</p>

<h3>What is HTTPS?</h3>
<p>Since your HTTP request can be read by anyone at certain network junctures, it might not be a good idea to deliver information such as your credit card or password using this protocol. Fortunately, many servers support HTTPS, short for HTTP Secure, which allows you to encrypt data that you send and receive.</p>

<p>HTTPS is important to use when passing sensitive or personal information to and from websites. However, it is up to the businesses maintaining the servers to set it up. In order to support HTTPS, the business must apply for a certificate from a Certificate Authority.</p>

<h1>Forms</h1>
<p>An HTML form element (&lt;form&lt;) is responsible for collecting information to send somewhere else. </p>

<p>Example:</p>
<p>&lt;form action="/example.html" method="POST"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</p>
<p>In the above example, we’ve created the skeleton for a &lt;form&gt; that will send information to example.html as a POST request:</p>

<p>The action attribute determines where the information is sent.</p>
<p>The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.</p>
<h3>Let's first explore a text value for the type attribute. </h3>
<p>&lt;form action="/example.html" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text name="first-text-field"&gt;</p>
<p>It is also important that we include a name attribute otherwise the information typed in the input field won't be sent when the form is submitted.</p>
<p>When initially loaded it would be an empty box. </p>
<p>Let's say the user typed the words, "important details" into the text box.
  Then when the form is submitted:</p>
<p>"first-text-field"=important details" would be sent to /example.html because the value of the name attribute is "first-text-field" and the value of value is "important details"</p>
<p>The label element is so that the user can identify what the text field is for. It will display what text is written between the opening and closing tags.  To associate a label element with its corresponding input field, the input needs an id attribute and the label needs a matching for attribute. </p>
<p>&lt;label for="meal"&gt;What do you want to eat?&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="food" id="meal"&gt; </p>
  <label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
  <br>
  <input type="text" name="food" id="meal"> 
<h3>Let's explore the password value for the type attribute</h3>
<p>An &lt;input type ="password"&gt; will replace input text with asterisk or dots
  Here is an example of how to create a password field:</p>
<p>&lt;form&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;label for="user-password"&gt;Password: &lt;/label&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;input type="password" id="user-password" name="user-password"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/form&gt;</p>
<div>
  <form>
    <label for="user-password">Password: </label>
    <input type="password" id="user-password" name="user-password">
  </form>
  <form>
    <label for="user-password">Password: </label>
    <input type="password" id="user-password" name="user-password">
</div>
<p>Even thought the field obscures the text, when the form is submitted
  "user-password=hunter2" is sent along with the other information in the form.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Let's explore the number attribute</h3>
<p>for 
  an input type of number will restrict what users can type into the input field.  
  <strong>Just numbers and +, -, and .</strong>
  </p>
<p>A step attribute equal to 1 creates arrows inside the input field to increase or decrease the number by 1.</p>
<form>
  <label for="months">How many months have you been coding?(this has no step attribute so it defaults to one)</label>
  <input type="number" id="months" name="lengthinmonths">
</form>
<form>
  <label for="months2">How many months have you been coding? (this has a step attribute of 0.5)</label>
  <input type="number" id="months2" name="lengthinmonths" step="0.5">
</form>
<h3>Let's explore the Checkbox Input</h3>
<p>If we presented multiple options to users and allow them to select any number of options then we would need a checkbox for the type attribute of an input element.</p>
<p>You need to create labels for each of the checkboxes, otherwise the user would just see boxes.</p>
<p>The id attribute of the checkbox is what pairs it with the label.  The name attribute is what gives it a value.  The value attribute is what the value is set equal to.  So the name attribute could be the same for several different checkboxes. Have the same name attribute will group these inputs together.</p>
<form>
  <div><strong>What is your favorite part about going to Nashville Software School?</strong></div>
  <label for="friends">Making New Friends</label>
  <input id="friends" name="bestpart" type="checkbox" value="NewFriends">
  <br>
  <label for="neighborhood">Location Of School In Proximity to Dozen</label>
  <input id="neighborhood" name="bestpart" type="checkbox" value="GreatHood">
  <br>
  <label for="learning">Learning New Things</label>
  <input id="learning" name="bestpart" type="checkbox" value="NewThings">
</form>
<h3>The Radio Input.</h3>
<p>Checkboxes work well if we want to present users with multiple options and let them choose one or more of the options. However, there are cases where we want to present multiple options and only allow for one selection — in these cases we need to use the radio input option.</p>
<p>Very much like the checkboxes, we need to also include label elements for the user to know what they are choosing.</p>
<p>Radio buttons that are grouped together under one question should have the same name.</p>
<p>The value would be what differentiates them.
</p>
<form>
  <div><strong>What is 2+2?</strong></div>
  <input type="radio" name="answer" id="4">
  <label for="4">4</label>
  <input type="radio" name="answer" id="5">
  <label for="5">5</label>
</form>
<h3>Dropdown lists</h3>
<p>Allows our users to choose one option from an organized list.</p>
<p>You would use a select element (opening and closing tags) and within the select element you would have option elements (with closing tags) for each of the items you'd like displayed in the dropdown.</p>
<p>Each option has a value attribute.  The value is set equal to the name of the select. 

</p>
<form>
  <label for="city">What's your favorite city you've ever lived in?</label>
  <select id="city" name="city">
    <option value="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</option>
    <option value="Austin">Austin</option>
    <option value="Nashville">Nashville</option>
  </select>
</form>
<h3>Datalists</h3>
<p>They are nested within an input type of text. The inputs with type of text also needs to have a list attribute whose value matches the id attribute of the datalist.  Users can type into the text field and filter options from the datalist. If non of the options match what the user types, the user can still submit what they've typed in. When the form is submitted, the value that the user typed in or selected is submitted paired with the name of the input field.</p>
<p>You need to have an option element nested under the datalist element.  The value of these options are what will display when you are searching </p>
<form>
  <label for="vacation">Where have you always wanted to take a vacation?</label>
  <input type="text" id="vacation" list="places" name="vacation">
    <datalist id="places">
      <option value="Paris"></option>
      <option value="Prague"></option>
      <option value="Tulum"></option>
      <option value="New York City"></option>
      <option value="Taos"></option>

    </datalist>
</form>
<h3>Text Area</h3>
<p>While an input element with the type="text" creates a single row input field for users to type in info, the texture allows for the users to write more information.</p>
<p>We can add the attribute rows and cols for the size of the text area.</p>
<form>
  <label for="feels"><strong>Tell me how you feel after looking through this 90s site with no styling</strong></label>
<br>
  <textarea id="feels" rows="7" cols="40">

  </textarea>
</form>
<h3>Submitting A Form</h3>
<p>Within the form element, use an input element with a type="submit" to make a button to submit the form.  You can also give this input a value attribute.  Its value will be what is printed on the button, or without this attribute, by default, it will read submit.</p>
<h2>Things that I learned:</h2>
<p>&lt;hr&gt; is a horizontal rule element.  It defines a thematic break in an HTML page. This is what is creating the small lines between sections on this page.</p>
<p><strong>Shift + Cmd + L</strong> will select all of something in Visual Studio Code if you want to change it or something</p>
<p>A form's <strong>action</strong> attribute determines where the form's information goes.</p>
<p>a form's <strong>method</strong> determines how the information is sent and processed. </p>
<p>When a form is submitted, the name of the fields that accept input and the value of those fields are sent as name=value pairs.</p>
